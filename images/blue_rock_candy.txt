Good product. Too good. The reason two stars are missing from my rating is because I sold an ounce to a guy named Tat and now he won't leave me alone. He shows up outside my apartment, at my school, and even when I'm out with my family. He's always begging me for "the good stuff." Seeing how often I'm having to re-up, I think I'll try to cut a deal with the Superior Nut Company for wholesale shipments. They can ship it to me through the Greeks down at the docks.
